description: Diagnose GitHub Actions failures via the `gh` CLI — fetch logs, classify the root cause, and recommend a fix. Use when a workflow run failed and the user needs to know why, when detecting flaky tests across recent runs, profiling slow steps, analyzing failure history, or watching a live run. Stop clicking through the GitHub UI.

# gh-logs

CI log analyst. Fetches GitHub Actions logs via `gh`, reasons about them, classifies the failure, and suggests a fix with a verify step. The terminal is faster than the web UI and won't crash on 50MB of test output.

## When to use

- "CI is broken / red / failing — what happened?"
- "Why did this run fail?" (with or without a run ID / URL)
- "Is this test flaky?" — `--flaky`
- "Why is the build so slow?" — `--slow`
- "Has this been failing for a while?" — `--history`
- "Watch this run and tell me when it's done / why it failed" — `--watch`

## When NOT to use

- Viewing passing-run logs for debugging successful runs — use `gh run view <id> --log` directly.
- Editing workflow YAML — this skill reads runs, it doesn't author workflows.
- Running or re-running workflows — that's `gh workflow run` / `gh run rerun`.

## Mode → reference routing

| Mode | Primary reference | Output template |
|---|---|---|
| Default diagnose | [`references/failure-patterns.md`](references/failure-patterns.md) | [`references/analysis-templates.md`](references/analysis-templates.md) |
| `--flaky` | [`references/failure-patterns.md`](references/failure-patterns.md) (test signatures) | [`references/analysis-templates.md`](references/analysis-templates.md) |
| `--slow` | [`references/gh-commands.md`](references/gh-commands.md) (timing jq) | [`references/analysis-templates.md`](references/analysis-templates.md) |
| `--history` | — | [`references/analysis-templates.md`](references/analysis-templates.md) |
| `--watch` | — | [`references/analysis-templates.md`](references/analysis-templates.md) |

Full `gh` invocation cookbook lives in [`references/gh-commands.md`](references/gh-commands.md).

## Arguments

- `(none)` — auto-detect repo + branch, find latest failed run, diagnose
- `<run-id>` — analyze a specific run by ID
- `<workflow-name>` — filter to a specific workflow
- `--flaky` — detect flaky tests by comparing recent runs
- `--slow` — profile step timing, find bottlenecks
- `--history [n]` — analyze the last n failures (default 10)
- `--watch` — monitor a running workflow; auto-diagnose on failure

## Default workflow (diagnose)

### 1. Preflight

```bash
gh auth status 2>&1 | head -3
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner'
```

If auth fails, tell the user to run `gh auth login`. If not in a git repo, ask for the repo.

### 2. Find the run

No arg — latest failure on current branch, fall back to all branches:

```bash
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
gh run list --branch "$BRANCH" --status failure --limit 1 \
  --json databaseId,displayTitle,conclusion,event,headBranch,workflowName,createdAt
```

With a run ID — use directly. With a workflow name — add `--workflow <name>`.

### 3. Get the overview

```bash
gh run view <run-id> --json jobs \
  --jq '.jobs[] | {name, conclusion, steps: [.steps[] | select(.conclusion == "failure") | {name, conclusion}]}'
```

This tells you which jobs failed and which steps inside them.

### 4. Fetch the failing logs

```bash
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```

If output is >5000 lines, narrow to a specific job: `gh run view <run-id> --job <job-id> --log-failed`. If still too large, `gh api` the raw log and `grep` for `error`/`FAIL`/`fatal`.

### 5. Classify

Match log lines against [`references/failure-patterns.md`](references/failure-patterns.md). Pick one primary category:

| Category | Strongest signals |
|---|---|
| **test** | `FAIL`, `AssertionError`, `--- FAIL:`, snapshot mismatch |
| **build** | `error TS`, `Build failed`, `Rollup failed to resolve`, `undefined:` |
| **deps** | `ERESOLVE`, `404 Not Found`, `ETARGET`, `ECONNREFUSED` to registry |
| **lint** | `X errors found`, biome/eslint/prettier output |
| **auth** | `403`, `401`, `Permission denied (publickey)`, missing secret |
| **infra** | `Killed` (137), `No space left`, `heap out of memory`, runner shutdown |
| **timeout** | `exceeded maximum execution time`, stuck for 10+ min |

**When multiple categories match** (common — e.g., an OOM during tests looks like both `infra` and `test`): pick the most *upstream* cause, because that's what needs to be fixed. Priority: `auth` > `deps` > `build` > `infra` > `lint` > `test` > `timeout`. A test failing *because* deps didn't install is a deps bug, not a test bug. When it's genuinely ambiguous, surface both and ask the user which feels right — a wrong classification leads to a wrong fix.

### 6. Report

Use the diagnosis template in [`references/analysis-templates.md`](references/analysis-templates.md). Always include:

1. **Category** and the failed step / job name
2. **Root cause** — 1–2 sentences, specific
3. **Log excerpt** — the lines that proved it, truncated if long
4. **Suggested fix** — actionable, with commands or code
5. **Verify command** — how to re-run and confirm the fix worked

## Other modes

### Flaky test detection — `--flaky`

```bash
gh run list --branch "$BRANCH" --limit 20 --json databaseId,conclusion
```

For each failed run, extract failed test names from the log. Tests that fail in some runs but pass in others are flaky. Report with pass/fail ratio and the suspected mechanism (race condition, timing dependency, shared port, external service, test ordering). See `references/analysis-templates.md` for the output shape.

### Slow step profiling — `--slow`

```bash
gh run view <run-id> --json jobs \
  --jq '.jobs[].steps[] | {name, startedAt: .started_at, completedAt: .completed_at, conclusion}'
```

Compute durations, sort descending, identify bottlenecks. Suggest cache, parallelism, or dropping the step.

### History — `--history [n]`

```bash
gh run list --status failure --limit <n> \
  --json databaseId,displayTitle,conclusion,event,headBranch,workflowName,createdAt
```

For each, pull failed job/step names. Surface recurring patterns: same step, specific branch, time-of-day correlation.

### Watch — `--watch`

```bash
gh run watch --exit-status
```

When it finishes, if it failed, drop into diagnose mode on the resulting run ID.

## Example — auto-diagnose

```text
User: /gh-logs

Claude: Checking CI for branch feat/auth-flow...
Found failed run #4521 (CI / test) from 3 minutes ago.

## Diagnosis

Category: test
Failed step: Run tests (job: test-ubuntu)
Root cause: Snapshot mismatch in LoginForm — expected output changed after adding the "Remember me" checkbox.

Log excerpt:
  FAIL src/components/LoginForm.test.tsx
  - renders login form (2ms)
    Expected: "<form>..."
    Received: "<form>...<label>Remember me</label>..."
  1 snapshot failed.

Fix:
  bun test -- -u src/components/LoginForm.test.tsx

Verify:
  git add -A && git commit -m "test: update LoginForm snapshot" && git push && gh run watch
```

More session shapes (flaky / slow / history) are in [`references/analysis-templates.md`](references/analysis-templates.md).

## Edge cases

| Situation | Handling |
|---|---|
| No failures found | Report "no failed runs on <scope>" and suggest widening (different branch, include success, workflow filter). |
| `gh` rate limit (403) | Back off, tell the user which call hit the limit. |
| Logs >5000 lines | Narrow to failing job, then grep for `error`/`FAIL`/`fatal` if still too large. |
| No `gh` installed | `brew install gh` or <https://cli.github.com>. |
| Not authenticated | `gh auth login`. |
| Private repo / no access | `gh` returns 404; explain required permissions. |
| Multiple failed jobs | Diagnose each; lead the report with the most upstream cause. |
| Cancelled runs | Infra category. Check if cancellation was manual, timeout, or concurrency. |
